FIXES:
->When creating a new file by writing in an empty editor, then closing this file without saving it
    write again in the empty editor generates an error

FUNCT:
->Create a standard layout component for all the modals (header, content, footer)
->Create a general a "general error" popup
    -> Extend this popup type to an confirmation popup
    -> Create a standard confirmation popup which will take action as parameter
    -> Add a confirmation before deleting a file
    -> Add a general notice popup
->Reorganise the modal slice so that we would only have a unique open/close function which recieves a modal ID as a parameter.
->Implement closeAllModals for when clicking on a modal overlay
->Double click on TabBar to open new tab

DESÃ‘:
->Should redesign the close popup button
