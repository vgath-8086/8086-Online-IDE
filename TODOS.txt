FIXES:
✔️->When creating a new file by writing in an empty editor, then closing this file without saving it
    write again in the empty editor generates an error
✔️->The order in which the tabs are loaded
->When double-clicking on the "+" button to add a file, two files are add to the file system

FUNCT:
✔️->Add Ctrl-S support
✔️->Create a standard layout component for all the modals (header, content, footer)
->Create a general a "general error" popup
    -> Extend this popup type to the confirmation popup
    -> Create a standard confirmation popup which will take action as parameter
    -> Add a confirmation before deleting a file
    -> Add a general notice popup
✔️->Reorganise the modal slice so that we would only have a unique open/close function which recieves a modal ID as a parameter.
->Implement closeAllModals for when clicking on a modal overlay
✔️->Double click on TabBar to open new tab
->Add a small animation in the footer when a new info is displayed
->Add a message on the Save/Load/Manage popups when no file are found
->Make tab draggable

DESÑ:
->Should redesign the close popup button
->Should rethink the compilation error is notified: 
    Is it really a good idea to interreput the use with a Popup when a compilation error is raised?
    This can fustrate him, espacially if he repeatadly makes mistake in his code. So a more subtle way
    of displaying the error would be pretty much appreciated.

Bonne idée:
->Use an AI to generate a default name when saving a new file
->Restructure the modal system using pipelines
